# TL;DR

- I started using `eza` and graduated to `tree`.
- `eza-community/eza` is a fork of `ogham/exa`
- I still use `ls` too!

I love ls.
I can't remember how many times I've repeated the same thing.

We can use `ls` anywhere.

The nice thing about `eza` is that it is colorful.
It requires some installation, but I will try to be friends with it for a while.
