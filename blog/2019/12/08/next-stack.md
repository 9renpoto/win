# TL;DR

- <https://www.stackshare.io/9renpoto>
- Rails => [NestJS](https://github.com/9renpoto/backend)
- Swagger =>
  [GraphQL](https://github.com/9renpoto/backend/tree/master/apps/core)
- React => Preact
  - <https://github.com/9renpoto/frontend>
  - <https://github.com/g59/ranking>
- Self make auth => Firebase

## NestJS ( with GraphQL )

- [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.ml/) is cute
- We needs some SaaS (Stripe, Firebase, etc)

## GraphQL

- Type is justice
- Still challenging
  - [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql)
  - [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay)
  - [graphpl-react](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react)

## Preact

- Preact X is cute
- Small is worth

## Firebase

- We don't want to manage passwords
