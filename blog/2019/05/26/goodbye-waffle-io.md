A little while ago, [the service](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io) I used
all the time closed. waffle.io was an essential tool for my study.

Currently, we are trying to substitute alternatives using
[github project](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) and
[auto-assign](https://probot.github.io/apps/auto-assign/), but we have not
reached the point of request.

Thank you for waffle.io team works.
